TAROS (Towards Autonomous RObotic Systems) is an annual UK based robotics conference. This year the conference and proceedings focus on robotics, mechatronics, image processing, computer vision, and application-based systems, human computer interaction. This was the 25th annual conference which was held at Brunel University of London and was attend by many UK based academics as well as several oversea's researchers. TAROS is regarded as a great introductory conference for PGRs to submit to and attend to gain vital experience in the publication and presenting processes.

My Experience
------
Although I have presented works at different events, this was my first experience with publishing a paper and presenting this work at a conference. To say it was nervewracking is an understatement! Having your research scrutinised by friends and supervisors is one thing but when it is scrutinised by the experts in the field it brings all new emotions.

Luckily, I was not alone.
